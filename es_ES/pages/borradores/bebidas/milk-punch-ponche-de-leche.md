## Milk Punch - Ponche de leche

**Ingredientes**

5 cups of a mixture of whole milk and half-and-half (4:1 is suggested, but I might go more like 3:2 next time)
1 1/2 cups bourbon, another whiskey or brandy
1 cup powdered sugar, sifted
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
Freshly grated nutmeg, for garnish.

**Preparaci√≥n**

In a pitcher, whisk together milk, half-and-half, bourbon, sugar and vanilla. Freeze until slushy, which will take 3 to 4 hours, but you can leave it in there up to a day. Stir before serving it in chilled glasses, finished with a few gratings of fresh nutmeg.
