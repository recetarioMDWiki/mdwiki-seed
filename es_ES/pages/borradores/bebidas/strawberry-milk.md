## Strawberry Milk

**Ingredientes**

- 450 g de fresas, cortadas y en rodajas
- 1/2 cup de azúcar
- 3 cups de leche
- 1 cup de buttermilk

**Preparación**

Mix strawberries and sugar in the bottom of a bowl (or even your blender’s bowl) and let them macerate for at least an hour, or until very syrupy. The more juice they exude now, the better. Blend strawberries and juices until smooth, then pour into a pitcher along with milk and buttermilk. Stir and let steep overnight in the fridge. In the morning, mix again if needed, and pour into glasses. Repeat as long as it lasts.

**Notas**

Para 4 vasos grandes.
