## Blackberry Crumble Bars

**Ingredientes**

*For the blackberry jam*

- 16 ounces blackberries
- 1/3 cup sugar
- 2 tablespoons water
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

*For the oatmeal bar*

- 1/2 cup salted butter, room temperature
- 1/2 cup white sugar
- 1/3 cup dark brown sugar
- 1 large egg, room temperature
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1 cup old-fashioned oats

**Preparación**

In a medium saucepan over medium heat, cook the blackberries, sugar, and water for 15 minutes. Mash the blackberries as they cook to help them break down. You know the mixture is ready when it resembles the texture of jam and pulls away from the bottom of the pan. Remove from heat, stir in vanilla extract, and allow to cool slightly.
Preheat oven to 350°F and line an 8″x8″ glass pan with parchment paper. Set aside.
In a standing mixer fitted with paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugars for 1-2 minutes, until light and fluffy. Beat in the egg and vanilla extract for another minute.
In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking soda, salt, and nutmeg. Stir flour mixture, along with oats, into the wet ingredients.
Place half of batter into prepared pan, spreading to the edges. Dollop in blackberry jam. Break remaining oatmeal batter into pieces and place over jam. Bake for 30 mins, or until a knife inserted in the center of the bars comes out clean. Allow to cool slightly before serving!

**Ingredientes**

*Crumbs*

- 1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- 3 cups (390 grams) all-purpose flour
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- Zest of one lemon
- 1 cup (8 ounces or 225 grams) cold unsalted butter, cut into chunks
- 1 large egg

*Berries*

- Juice of 1 lemon
- 1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar
- 4 teaspoons cornstarch
- 4 cups fresh blueberries

**Preparación**

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9×13 inch pan.
In a medium bowl, stir together 1 cup sugar, 3 cups flour, baking powder, salt, and lemon zest. Use a fork or pastry cutter to blend in the butter and egg. Dough will be crumbly. Pat half of dough into the prepared pan.

In another bowl, stir together the sugar, cornstarch and lemon juice. Gently mix in the blueberries. Sprinkle the blueberry mixture evenly over the crust. Crumble remaining dough over the berry layer.

Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until top is slightly brown. (This took an extra 10 to 15 minutes in my oven.) Cool completely before cutting into squares.
