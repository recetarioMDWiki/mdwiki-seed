## Blueberry Oatmeal Quick Bread

**Ingredientes**

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 cup sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup Greek yogurt
- 2 eggs
- ½ cup 1 stick butter, melted and cooled slightly
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- ½ cup oats
- 1 cup fresh blueberries*

**Preparación**

Preheat the oven to 375°F. Spray a 9×5-inch loaf pan with baking spray or canola oil and line with parchment paper, or lightly butter the pan and dust with a spoonful of flour.
In a large mixing bowl, whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. In a separate bowl, use a fork to mix together the yogurt, eggs, melted butter, and vanilla, then fold into the dry ingredients. Mix in the oats then gently fold in the blueberries, reserving a few to dot the top of the batter. The batter should be thick and a little sticky.
Scrape the mixture into the loaf pan. Bake for 45-55 minutes or until golden brown and when a toothpick inserted into the bread comes out clean. Remove from the oven and cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to continue cooling. Serve warm or at room temperature. The bread will be more firm after it has cooled completely.

**Notas**

I can't speak to whether frozen blueberries would work as well since I've only used fresh.
