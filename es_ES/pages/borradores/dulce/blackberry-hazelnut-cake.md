## Blackberry Hazelnut Cake

**Ingredientes**

*for the cake*

- 3/4 cup brown rice flour
- 1/4 cup hazelnut meal (ground from whole toasted and shelled hazelnuts)
- 2 tbsp arrowroot powder
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 cup coconut oil (soft, not melted)
- 2 eggs, room temperature
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk
- *1 cup fresh blackberries*

*for the frosting*

- 150g butter, softened at room temperature
- 180 – 200g (1 1/4 – 1 1/2 cups) powdered sugar, sifted
- 200g cream cheese, cold (or substitute with vegan cream cheese)

**Preparación**

*for the cake*

1. Toast a heaping 1/4 cup of whole hazelnuts at 350°F for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool before shelling. Transfer cooled hazelnuts to a food processor and grind to create a meal. Do not grind too much, or the hazelnuts will turn into a paste (hello, Nutella!).
2. Keep the oven preheated to 350°F. Grease and line two 6-inch cake pans with parchment paper. Dust the edges with a bit of brown rice flour. Set aside.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the brown rice flour, hazelnut meal, arrowroot powder, salt, and baking powder. Set aside.
3. In a large bowl, cream together the granulated sugar and coconut oil until light and fluffy. Add in each egg one at a time, beating until fully combined between each addition. Add in the vanilla extract and almond milk. Mix for 30 seconds.
4. Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet in several additions. Mix until the batter is smooth and evenly combined.
5. Split the cake batter evenly between the two cake pans. Bake for 20-25 minutes until a toothpick inserted comes out clean. Be careful not to over bake the cake, otherwise it will lose its moistness. The top of the cake may seem slightly sticky even though it is fully baked.
6. Let cool inside the cake pan for 20 minutes. Remove and let cool completely. Cover each cake layer in plastic wrap and let rest in the fridge for an hour or up to one day.

*for the frosting*

1. Beat the softened butter until pale, about 2 minutes.
2. Pour in the sifted powdered sugar in two additions, beating for 1-2 minutes between each addition.
3. Add the cream cheese and beat just until smooth.

assembly:
Remove the cake layers from the fridge. Set the first layer down on your desired serving dish. Spread a thick layer of frosting on the cake. Cut 4 blackberries in half and space them out around the top of the frosting. Add a few more spoonfuls of frosting to cover up the blackberries.
Add the second cake layer on top of the frosting, pushing down gently till some of the frosting slightly comes out the side. Spread another layer of frosting onto the top of the cake, pushing the frosting past the circumference of the cake. Use your offset spatula to spread the frosting down the sides of the cake. Use the extra frosting in the bowl to cover up any naked patches. This is essentially only the crumb coat step of frosting a cake.
Chill in the fridge for 10-15 minutes for the cream cheese frosting to thicken. Serve and cut with a sharp knife.
