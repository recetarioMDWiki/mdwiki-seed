## Almond Joy Granola Bars

**Ingredientes**

*For the granola bars*

- 2 cups old fashioned oats
- 1/2 cup toasted coconut flakes (I used sweetened, but you can use whatever you prefer), plus more for sprinkling (optional)
- 2 tablespoons chia seeds
- 1/2 cup organic flax seeds
- 1/4 cup mini chocolate chips
- 3/4 cup whole roasted almonds
- 1/4 cup coconut oil
- 1/3 cup almond butter
- 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
- 1/3 cup honey

*For the chocolate coconut drizzle*

- 1/4 cup chocolate chips
- 1 1/2 teaspoons coconut oil

**Preparación**

Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a 9×13 inch pan with parchment paper. Set aside.

In a large bowl, combine oats, coconut flakes, chia seeds, flax seeds, mini chocolate chips, and roasted almonds. Stir until combined.

In a separate bowl, combine coconut oil, almond butter, vanilla extract, and honey. Pour into oat mixture and stir with a spatula until evenly combined.

Pour mixture into pan, spreading evenly to the edges (use the spatula to smooth things out). Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the granola is lightly golden brown along the edges. Allow to cool completely (placing them in the fridge for about 30 minutes does the trick).

Combine the chocolate chips and coconut oil in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave in 15 second intervals, stirring between each, until melted. Place into a ziplock bag and cut a small slit in one corner. Drizzle over cooled granola bars, and sprinkle with extra toasted coconut, if using. Cut into 18 rectangles and serve!
