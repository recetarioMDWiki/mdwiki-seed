## 30 Minutes Chocolate Cake for Two

**Ingredientes**

*For the cake*

- 1/2 cup sugar
- 7 tablespoons all purpose flour
- 3 tablespoons cocoa powder
- 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1 egg
- 1/4 cup milk
- 2 tablespoons canola oil
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons water

*For the frosting*

- 4 tablespoons butter, room temperature
- 3 tablespoons cocoa
- 1/2 cup powdered sugar
- 2 tablespoons milk
- Dark chocolate shavings (optional)

**Preparación**

In a small bowl, mix together all dry cake ingredients with a fork. Add in wet ingredients, stirring until combined. Heavily grease three large mugs* and evenly distribute batter into mugs (~1/2 cup of batter each).
Microwave each mug by itself for 1 minute on high. Remove from microwave and shake slightly to loosen cake from mug. Flip mug over onto parchment paper-lined plate or board. The cake should drop right out. Repeat with remaining mugs, then place into freezer for 5 minutes, or until the cakes cool to room temperature.
While the cakes are cooling, make the frosting. Combine all ingredients in a standing mixer and beat on high until light and fluffy, about 1 minute. Remove cakes from freezer and frost the top of each layer before stacking. If using, shave dark chocolate over the top of the cake using a sharp knife.

**Notas**

*don’t have 3 uniform mugs? Use one, cleaning thoroughly between cooking each layer!

One thing I will mention about this cake is that microwaves greatly vary in the time it takes to cook things. The cake should spring back to the touch after being cooked. If you find that your first mug is over/undercooked, adjust your time by ± 10 seconds for your next two mugs.

Also, this recipe calls for three equal-sized mugs. If you don’t have any matching mugs, you can use the same mug for each cake layer. Just wash it out thoroughly between layers to make sure the mug cakes puff up perfectly.

Oh, and one last little note. Make sure the milk and egg are at room temperature before you make the cake batter. You want your batter to bake evenly in the microwave, so having all the ingredients at the same temperature is key.
