## Blueberry Muffins

**Ingredientes**

- 8 tablespoons unsalted butter melted and cooled
- 2 large eggs Gwyneth calls for organic, I used Omega-3 fortified
- 1/2 cup milk I used non-fat
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt Gwyneth calls for fine, I used kosher
- 2 1/2 cups blueberries

**Preparación**

Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Prepare a 12 tin muffin tin with liners or spray with non-stick cooking spray.

Whisk together the butter, eggs and milk in a medium bowl. In a large bowl, whisk flour, 3/4 cup sugar, baking powder and salt. Stir wet ingredients into dry ingredients then gently fold in blueberries. 

Divide the batter evenly among the muffin tins. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until an inserted toothpick tests clean. Eat warm with more butter (my daughter’s favorite way) or at room temperature.
