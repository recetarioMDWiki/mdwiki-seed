## Bourbon Apple Pie Ice Cream

**Ingredientes**

*For the apple pie bits*

- 2 large (3 medium) apples
- 2 tablespoons light (or medium) brown sugar
- 1/4 cup Berentzen’s Bushel & Barrel bourbon
- 2 teaspoons cinnamon
- 1/8 nutmeg
- 1/8 cloves
- juice of 1/2 lemon
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

*For the oatmeal cookies*

- 1/4 cup unsalted butter, room temp
- 1 egg white
- 1/2 cup light (or medium) brown sugar
- 1/2 cup flour
- 1/3 cup oatmeal
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

*For the ice cream base*

- 1 1/2 cups whole milk
- 1 1/2 cups heavy cream
- 5 egg yolks
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1/4 cup light or medium brown sugar
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1/8 teaspoon cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 cup Berentzen’s Bushel & Barrel bourbon

**Preparación**

Prepare the ice cream the night before
In a large pot, combine whole milk and sugars. Use a wooden spoon or spatula to stir the mixture gently the entire time.* Heat on medium-low heat until the mixture reaches 180°F. Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks in a small bowl until light and pale yellow in color. Temper the yolks by adding a small amount (1/4 – 1/2 a cup) of the warm milk mixture into the egg bowl, stirring while you incorporate. Pour the warmed egg yolks into the milk pot, again stirring while you incorporate.
Continue to stir the mixture slowly for about 5 minutes. Your custard will be ready when the mixture begins to thicken and coats the back of a spoon. Don’t let the mixture cook for much longer, or the eggs will cook and the custard will curdle. Remove from heat and stir in heavy cream, vanilla extract, spices, and salt. Pour into a freezer-safe container and allow to chill for at least 12 hours (overnight is perfect!)
Make the apple pie bits
Presumably in the morning, cut the apples into 1 centimeter cubes and place in a medium pot. Toss with all other ingredients. Cook over medium heat for 20-25 minutes, until apples are soft and mushy. Should your mixture become dry, add a tablespoon of water at a time to the pot. You may add up to 1/2 cup of water throughout cooking. Once apple mixture has cooked, allow to cool for 10 minutes, then pulse in an immersion blender until the mixture becomes slightly homogenous, but still so small chunks of apple remain (these provide great texture in the ice cream!!).
Make the oatmeal cookies
Preheat oven to 350°F. Combine all ingredients except for oatmeal in a small mixing bowl and stir until combined. Once combined, fold in oatmeal.
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silpat. Scoop dough into 6-8 balls and place on the sheet. Bake for about 12 minutes, or until the cookies begin to brown at the edges. Allow to cool completely before breaking into pea sized pieces.
Churn the ice cream
It’s time! Churn the ice cream according to your manufacturer’s instructions. Once it is churned, fold in the oatmeal cookie pieces and apple bits! Scoop into a freezer-safe container and allow to chill for at least 6 hours, or again overnight.

**Notas**

Be very careful not to whisk your mixture or stir to heavily, or it will foam and separate
