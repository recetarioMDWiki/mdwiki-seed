## Apple Crumb Pie

**Ingredientes**

*Dough*

- 3 Cups all purpose flour
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 1 C unsalted butter cold
- 6-10 Tbsp ice water

*Topping*

- 1/2 C unsalted butter melted
- 1/2 C light brown sugar
- 1/2 C granulated sugar
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 1 1/4 C all purpose flour
- 1 C old fashioned oats

*Filling*

- 8-10 medium apples
- 3/4 C granulated sugar
- 1 Tbsp cinnamon
- 1/4 C all purpose flour

**Preparación**

In a food processor, combine 3 cups flour with salt and cinnamon. Transfer cold cubed butter to food processor. With food processor running, begin adding 1 Tbsp ice water at a time until dough pulls together, but is not sticky. Shape dough into a ball and transfer to a large plastic bag. Flatten dough down into a disc. Chill for at least 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 350°F.

On a silicone counter mat or a well floured surface, roll out dough to fit a 9x13 jelly roll pan with some overhang. Carefully transfer dough to pan, pressing into the corners. Fold dough over to create a thicker edge. Chill until ready to fill.

In a medium bowl, combine crumb topping ingredients until all ingredients are well incorporated. Transfer to a large baking sheet. Break up mixture into small pieces. Set aside.

Peel and chop apples. Toss with a splash of lemon juice if needed to prevent browning. In a large bowl, toss together apples with remaining filling ingredients. Transfer to prepared pie dough. Cover well with crumb topping.

Bake for 60 minutes or until apples are tender and topping is crisp.

Cool completely before slicing.
