## Linguine with Clam Sauce - Linguine con Vongole

**Ingredientes**

- 1 pound dried linguine
- Kosher salt
- 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 4 cloves garlic thinly sliced
- 2 pounds small clams in their shells, such as cockles of baby clams (about 48-50)
- 1 cup dry white wine
- 1/2 cup clam juice
- 1 medium tomato crushed well with your fingers and the skins removed
- 3/4 teaspoon red chile flakes
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley
- Freshly ground black pepper

**Preparación**

Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Season generously with kosher salt and add the linguine, cooking until tender but al dente. 

As the pasta cooks, get started on the sauce. Heat a large sauté pan over medium heat and add the olive oil with the garlic and cook, stirring, until golden. Add the clams and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the wine, clam juice, tomatoes, and red pepper flakes and stir. Cover, reduce to a simmer, and cook until the clams open and the liquid has reduced and thickened slightly, about 5 minutes. 

Once the pasta is done cooking, reserve 1/4 cup of the pasta cooking water and drain the linguine. Add the pasta to the clams and sauce and toss in the parsley. Season with salt and pepper to taste and toss until the pasta is evenly coated. If the sauce is too thick, add some of the reserved pasta water a little at a time. Cook over low heat for 1-2 minutes and serve immediately.
